# Car Hire Live Prices

Retrieve live prices for car hire providers.

The live updates are performed asynchronously so you need to create a session and then poll for updates.
Please note that it may take up to a minute to update all the results. After you create a session, you will immediately get the results of the first poll.

The Create Session request (HTTP GET) contains all query parameters, such as pickup and dropoff locations. The URL which should be used to poll the session is returned in the HTTP Response Header "Location".

The Poll Session (HTTP GET) should be used to poll the session at a suitable interval (e.g. every 1-3 seconds) whilst there are still updates pending.


## Creating the session

```shell
curl "https://skyscanner.net/chiron/carhire/liveprices/v2/
  {market}/{currency}/{locale}/
  {pickupplace}/{dropoffplace}/
  {pickupdatetime}/{dropoffdatetime}/
  {driverage}?apiKey={apiKey}&userip={userip}}"
  -X GET
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
  -H "Accept: application/jsonp"

```

*RESPONSE PARAMETERS*

| Element | Detail |
| ------- | ------ |
| `Location Header` | Contains the URL for polling the results. |


## Polling the results

Polling the session will return the details of all possible car hire quotes that satisfy the request query parameters. Prices will be obtained for the car hire quotes during the session. The calling application should poll the session in 1-3 second intervals until all updates are complete (all returned websites have inProgress equal to false), and all prices have been populated. This can take from a few seconds to a minute depending on the query.

Please allow at least one second between polls.

A note about delta results

In your polling requests you may specify a parameter called 'deltaExcludeWebsites'. This is a CSV or semicolon-separated list of website IDs. The server will set this in the Location headers to exclude whatever websites have finished sending results (inProgress equal to false). Excluding any given provider will remove its cars and website information from your result. Merely supplying&deltaExcludeWebsites= removes all images, the query, and the car classes lookup. The Location header in the first poll will include this parameter, even if it's an empty string, in order that you don't fetch that information multiple times.


```shell
curl "https://skyscanner.net/chiron/carhire/liveprices/v2/{sessionKey}?apiKey={apiKey}&deltaExcludeWebsites={a,b,c...}""
```
